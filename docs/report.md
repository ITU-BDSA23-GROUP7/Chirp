## Domain model

Here comes a description of our domain model.

![Illustration of the _Chirp!_ data model as UML class diagram.](images/BDSA_UML_Onion_architecture.png)

## Architecture â€” In the small

## Architecture of deployed application

## User activities

### Log in

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    state "Public timeline" as public
    state "Public timeline" as public2
    state "Log in" as login
    state if_state <<choice>>

    [*] --> public
    public --> login
    login --> if_state
    if_state --> public : No
    if_state --> public2 : Yes
    public2 --> [*]
```

## Sequence of functionality/calls trough _Chirp!_

#### Sequence diagram

```mermaid

    actor user as User
    participant webBrowser as WebBrowser
    participant app as Chirp.Razor
    participant auth as Azure authorization server
    participant db as Database

    user ->>+ webBrowser: Access Chirp
        webBrowser ->>+ app: GET

        app ->>+ auth: User.Identity.IsAuthenticated
        auth -->>- app: Response

        opt User is authenticated
            app -)+ db: UserNameExists()
            db --)- app: Response
            opt Username doesn't exist in db
                app -)+ db: CreateNewAuthor()

            db --)- app: IEnumerable<string>
        end

  state "Build Ubuntu" as build_ubuntu2
  state "Download Artifacts from Build" as download
  state "Deploy to Azure" as deploy
  

  [*] --> build_ubuntu : Push on main
  build_ubuntu -->  dotnet_build : Build Ubuntu for publishing project
  dotnet_build -->  if_state : Build Complete?

  if_state --> publish : True
